============
Python module for the Qwiic Button.

This python package is a port of the exisiting [SparkFun Qwiic Button Arduino Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Qwiic_Button_Arduino_Library)

This package can be used in conjunction with the overall [SparkFun Qwiic Python Package](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Py)

# Define the device name and I2C addresses. These are set in the class definition
# as class variables, making them available without having to create a class instance.

# This is the name of the device

# Define the class that encapsulates the device being created. All information associated 
# with this device is encapsulated by this class. The device class should be the only value
